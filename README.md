# PrudentChoice
An economics project for the independent study unit, By Yifei Zhang and Alan Ma.
This report studied multiple companies (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, McDonald's, and Sears) and how each one treated its employees.
<br>
The goal was to find out how companies used scarce resources to obtain as much productivity as possible, and we managed to find quite a variety of strategies.
<br>
Management paradigms are interesting indeed.
<br>
The design was inspired by Quora; built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jquery. Works alright (no nav bar) on mobile. Excuse the messy code as this was a time-constrained project.
