			<h4>Question: <span>How do businesses make decisions in order to maximize employee productivity?</span></h4>
			<h4>Task: <span>Gather data from employees from various companies to identify how businesses make prudent choices.</span></h4>
			<h5 id="1">Abstract</h5>
			<p>Rational choice is a core concept in economics that describes how individuals make decisions when it comes to preferences and purchases. There is an assumption that consumers will tend to choose the option that maximizes their utility and benefit from the decision. This behaviour also extends to decision making in businesses, where each choice affects the total revenue. In a world where resources are scarce, companies need to make careful decisions in how to use those resources in order to maximize revenue. In this report, we will be analyzing the behaviour of a variety of companies regarding their employees—specifically, the motivation of employees to provide value. The main factors included in this study include the workplace environment, organizational structure, availability of training, flexibility in scheduling, payment structure, free time, as well as advancement opportunities. Primary sources of data included in-person interviews were conducted whenever possible, and otherwise, Quora and Glassdoor – which provide content written directly by employees – were used. Secondary sources of data such as news articles were also utilized. The findings from the research provide insight into how different businesses make decisions in order to maximize their productivity.</p>
