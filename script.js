However, after reading through many posts written by both current and past “Googlers,” the shine of the corporation has dulled. Before going into some of the major negatives in the Google workplace, a general review of the advantages should be looked into first.<br>The luxurious workplace is one of the first things that the public imagines when someone mentions “Google.” This is true — the open floor concept includes themed sections that show the imagination of Google’s designers. These include colourful decorations, comfy seats, and an overall feeling of play rather than work. Themes range from designs inspired by nature, with picnic tables, all the way to egg-shaped workrooms" + reference("https://www.quora.com/How-is-Google-Zurich-different-from-other-Google-offices/answer/Sanchit-Alekh?srid=uiR9s") + ". Slides sit beside staircases, and bikes are available for employees to use.<br>The food provided by the company is cooked by professional chefs, allowing Google’s employees to feast on scrumptious eats while working on ingenious products. The gym gives facilities for workers to exercise, shower, and live a healthier life. There are even barbers available for haircuts right beside the workplace. In essence, Googlers could all but live at work — some actually have" + reference("https://www.quora.com/Which-Googler-holds-the-record-for-living-at-Google-HQ/answer/Ben-Discoe?srid=uiR9s") +"!<br>Another amazing benefit is the insurance that Google provides for its employees as well as their families. If, for some reason, a current Google employee dies, the company will provide half of the employee’s salary to the spouse for the next 10 years" + reference("https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-Google-employee-perk-and-why/answer/Paul-Cowan-3?srid=uiR9s") + ". “Baby bonding bucks” is also given to new parents — dads can take 6 weeks of paid leave, while moms can take up to 18 weeks of paid leave to take care of their new child" + reference("https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-Google-employee-perk-and-why/answer/Aaron-Lichtig?srid=uiR9s") + ".<br>All in all, these benefits sound like an amazing deal of employees, and the company seems to be a dream job for any aspiring individual. However, there is a method to all this madness. These benefits and capital invested in the workplace environment are all in order to increase employee productivity. There’s no such thing as a free lunch — these benefits that Google provides for its employees are all in order to make employees blur the lines between work and life; if employees can work while eating lunch, exercising, and even showering, then the company gets more value out of the worker. It is all to make employees more productive" + reference("http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/16/business/at-google-a-place-to-work-and-play.html") + ".<br>One point that many ex-Googlers bring up is the company politics. As with any large corporation, management and competition within the business start to become worse and worse. Especially in a company like Google, where there are many, many intellectuals competing for the same resources (such as higher-tier positions and promotions), struggling to overcome peers can become highly stressful and demotivating" + reference("https://www.quora.com/How-political-is-the-Google-work-environment/answer/Jeff-Nelson-32?srid=uiR9s") +".<br>Overall, even though Google tries to maximize its employee output by spending capital on the workplace environment and other benefits, other factors such as company politics may get in the way."

Since there are limited positions in the other major companies, such as Google, Facebook (who hire around 50000 a year), Amazon is free to treat employees however they want. Their high turnover rate does not influence overall company performance because of the large workforce that they can take advantage of."

In the past, Microsoft had used a form of employee evaluation known as “stack ranking,” where workers were slotted into one of several levels of performance.

		text: "McDonald’s hires almost 2 million employees, making it the largest fast food chain in the world. From humble beginnings in the 1950s, McDonald’s has grown rapidly throughout the years, constantly expanding into different markets. The work environment at McDonald’s varies from location to location, but generally they have evolved similarly across all locations.<br>Employees at McDonald’s are often said to have a McJob, which Oxford Dictionary defines as \"an unstimulating, low-paid job with few prospects, especially one created by the expansion of the service sector\"" + reference("http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32283560") + ". It is clear that job fulfillment are not the most important things that McDonald’s thinks off when creating their work environment. The environment at an average McDonald’s can become very stressful, as employees in the kitchen are constantly pressured to ensure no food wastage, and even shift managers seem to be as stressed out and overworked as the average employee. Why, if McDonald’s is so successful, do they need to constantly push their employees to the limits?<br>One of the largest contributors is the fact that McDonald’s is a franchise, meaning that individual McDonald’s locations are run by individuals who obtain a license to use the McDonald’s name. The franchisees are under constant pressure to keep their profit margins high, as their living depends on it. As a result, franchisees hire the bare minimum to ensure the are able to lower costs. With less than optimal employees working, each individual employee is forced to work harder, and to do more things for more people.<br>However, not all franchisees are the same, and we have interview results from current employees working at McDonalds. What we found was that on average, Canadian McDonald’s employees felt happier and more fulfilled compared to their American counterparts. A less stressful work environment and better management contribute to this fact. In Canada, due to less people in general, the number of people who go to fast food restaurants are significantly less compared to the US. Employees are not pushed as hard, and good management is able ensure that most employees are happy at their jobs.</p><img src='img/mcdonalds-glassdoor.png' alt='mcdonalds glassdoor'><p>From Glassdoor, we can see significant differences between the US and Canadian reviews. Most of the Canadian reviews are positive, citing flexible hours, and professional and qualified management. On the other hand, reviews from the United States were more likely to be negative, citing incompetent management that led to long hours, and no benefits and inconsistent policies.<br>While the reviews different for these aspects, one thing was clear: McDonald’s hires many part time workers. In fact, the majority of McDonald’s employees are part-time. This one small fact allows McDonald’s to still remain competitive, while companies like Sears are floundering and drowning. The poor work environment in many US locations do not matter as much, as there is no scarcity of employees needed. McDonald’s realizes that as people go through high school and university, many people decide to pursue part-time jobs, and this trend is unlikely to change in the future. McDonald’s is able to replenish their workforce very quickly, and the high turnover rates don’t matter as much. Their decision to have a stressful work environment suits their needs, and they are able to make sure that they can most efficiently continue their work."

Compared to reviews and studies that are generally conducted in the US, this specific location has good management and communication, as well as a very positive work environment. Due to a smaller market and demand for fast food in Canada, the pressure put on employees is lessened. With only around a tenth of the population of the US, most of the time, our interviewee describes work as “generally slow”, and “relaxing with good people”.<br>Generally, the interview shows that even for different locations, there are vast differences in work environment. This specific example is likely an outlier compared to the majority of other locations; most reviews and studies point towards a chaotic, challenging, and stressful work environment.

Due to increasingly high competition from large wholesale stores like Costco, or online delivery services like Amazon, Sears simply is unable to compete for the market share anymore.

With a measly 19% approval rate, Lampert is unliked by a significant portion of his employees.

It also seems that part-time employees, like students are less negative about Sears, as they have no stake in their job at that point. After graduating and finding another job, they have no reason to care anymore about the poor management or treatment that they are subject to from Sears.<br>However, there are thousands of negative reviews, ranging from poor management to horrible hours.

A lack of work-life balance is also perpetuated, as incompetence from management causes most employees to become alienated from their work. One employee states, “there’s so much infighting here [...], I’m glad I’m finishing my degree in 2 years.”<br>While this work environment is not necessarily the only contributor to Sears’ lack of success, it is certainly an important one.

From Google’s large investment in the workplace environment, to Amazon’s borderline abuse of workers, each company used different strategies to get the most out of their money.<br>In Google’s utopia-like workplace, the company seeks to blur the lines between work and life; employees can essentially live at the company, with free food and imaginary scenery. Amazing benefits and perks attract new workers as well as convince seasoned employees to stay. By giving facilities like gyms and showers, employees are encouraged to stay longer at work because of its convenience, thus increasing working hours. By reducing stress through relaxing environments, Google is able to tap into employees with higher capacities of productivity, at the same time giving them the ambience to create innovate products.<br>Microsoft’s management and human resources department see a different utopia from Google — instead of work, work, work, they envision a clear separation between work and life. Benefits such as relocation allowances focus on moving the entire family, and in the past, health coverage was 100% (although the high costs have pushed this out). The 401k retirement plan is plenty, and the maternity leave is quite long. Coupled with the fact that free food is not offered to encourage employees to go home to their families, Microsoft clearly wants its workers to have a good work/life balance. This is all for employees to go to work the next day with a positive outlook, reducing mistakes and increasing effectiveness.<br>On the opposite end of the spectrum, Amazon looks to take advantage of the excess amount of job seekers in the market. Because job positions are limited in more lucrative companies, Amazon is free to set its workplace environment standards low, as well as press their employees for more work. On one hand, Amazon is able to extract value from its large workforce availability, but on the other hand, its low employee happiness and high turnover rate are a large cost to its operations.<br>McDonald’s finds its competitive edge through part-time workers. With many people seeking some sort of income through their years in school, McDonald’s offers a place to work with nearly zero required work experience. This lets the company pay a minimal amount for all of its labour, and lets it keep costs down to rake in a profit.<br>Finally, a company not doing so well in the market was looked into — Sears. With a poor work environment, either incompetent or non-existent management, and dissatisfied employees, it is a good example of what can happen to an organization with incapable leadership.<br>That being said, even companies with spectacular leadership at the top still suffer from severe issues. Through the study of these companies, the major issues likely to be seen in any company are conflicts with management and competition for scarce resources. In many businesses, the manager is the one person who can “make it or break it”—in companies where there was conflicting reviews, the experience of the individuals were drastically different based on the supervisors. In large companies, situations with poor management will be inevitable, but corporations should take more interest in these issues, as it affects employee performance greatly, and may even cause potential star performers to be fired.<br>A more pressing issue is the competition that arises in the company. Because there is inherently limited resources to give out, high-tier positions are hard to come by. This leads to employees fighting against each other for those bonuses, rewards, and eventual promotions. In places like Google, where there are many highly-intelligent workers, competition can be very stressful. Cases like Microsoft’s WDG can arise, with backstabbing being a common theme in the office. Toxic competition can quickly turn the workplace in a hostile environment, which cuts off productivity and destroys the effectiveness of work. In order to reduce losses and manage risk, corporations should take a careful look into things like performance reviews and reward systems. Only a meticulous correction of issues related to hostile competition will lead to a more positive working environment.</p>');

While these types of issues are interesting to some extent, there could be so much more research into aspects such as employee hierarchy. However, poor management and competition tend to overpower other issues, meaning that information on other aspects is lost in the storm. What would be optimal is looking into a very large quantity of employees from small- to mid-scale businesses, such as local stores and barbers. However much entertaining it would be to waltz into shops asking employees about their feelings toward their employer, due to restrictions in feasibility, the available data was restricted.<br>This leads to the next improvement that could be made: the method of gathering data.

In addition to this, interviews with employees were conducted when possible.

This would provide more accurate feedback about factors in the work environment and how employers make choices in regard to its workers.

People can still work there once they go to university, they generally just work when coming back during winter and summer breaks.</i><br><b>That’s all the questions I have for you; do you have anything else you want to say about your work here at McDonalds?</b><br><i>Again, a lot of what I talked about here is about this specific location, and I know that other corporate stores are very bad where there’s a lot of exploitation and mistreatment of employees.</i><br><b>Thank you so much for your time!</b></p>');
